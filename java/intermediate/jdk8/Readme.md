1. JDK8 was created to simplify programming i.e way of writing code in less no. of lines.
2. It's also influenced by the hardware influence i.e CPU became multicore, majority of java programs used only one core.JDK8 enabled parallel programming/procesing so that Java programs can run in multi-processors.
3. Utilizes functional programming benefits into java.i.e we can pass code as method argument.
