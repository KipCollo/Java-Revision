# Java

Here’s a brief history of modern computer programming:

✓ 1954–1957: FORTRAN is developed.

FORTRAN was the first modern computer programming language. For scientific programming, FORTRAN is a real racehorse. Year after year,FORTRAN is a leading language among computer programmers through-out the world.

✓ 1959: Grace Hopper at Remington Rand develops the COBOL ­programming language.

The letter B in COBOL stands for Business, and business is just what COBOL is all about. The language’s primary feature is the processing of
one record after another, one customer after another, or one employee after another.
Within a few years after its initial development, COBOL became the most widely used language for business data processing. Even today, COBOL represents a large part of the computer programming industry.

✓ 1972: Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs develops the C programming language.

The “look and feel” that you see in this book’s examples comes from the C programming language. Code written in C uses curly braces, if statements, for statements, and so on.
In terms of power, you can use C to solve the same problems that you can solve by using FORTRAN, Java, or any other modern programming language. (You can write a scientific calculator program in COBOL,but doing that sort of thing would feel really strange.) The difference between one programming language and another isn’t power. The difference is ease and appropriateness of use. That’s where the Java language excels.

✓ 1986: Bjarne Stroustrup (again at AT&T Bell Labs) develops C++.

Unlike its C language ancestor, the language C++ supports object-oriented
programming. This support represents a huge step forward. (See the next
section in this chapter.)

✓ May 23, 1995: Sun Microsystems releases its first official version of the Java programming language.

Java improves upon the concepts in C++. Java’s “Write Once, Run Anywhere” philosophy makes the language ideal for distributing code
across the Internet.
Additionally, Java is a great general-purpose programming language.
With Java, you can write windowed applications, build and explore
databases, control handheld devices, and more. Within five short years,
the Java programming language had 2.5 million developers worldwide.
(I know. I have a commemorative T-shirt to prove it.)

✓ November 2000: The College Board announces that, starting in the
year 2003, the Computer Science Advanced Placement exams will be
based on Java.

✓ 2002: Microsoft introduces a new language named C#.Many of the C# language features come directly from features in Java.

✓ June 2004: Sys-Con Media reports that the demand for Java program-
mers tops the demand for C++ programmers by 50 percent (http://
java.sys-con.com/node/48507).
		And there’s more! The demand for Java programmers beats the combined
demand for C++ and C# programmers by 8 percent. Java programmers
are more employable than VB (Visual Basic) programmers by a whopping
190 percent.

✓ 2007: Google adopts Java as the primary language for creating apps on Android mobile devices.

✓ January 2010: Oracle Corporation purchases Sun Microsystems, ­bringing Java technology into the Oracle family of products.

✓ June 2010: eWeek ranks Java first among its “Top 10 Programming Languages to Keep You Employed” (www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development Top-10-Programming-Languages-to-Keep-You-Employed-719257).

✓ August 2013: Java runs on more than 1.1 billion desktop computers (http://java.com/en/about) and Android Java runs on 250 million mobile phones (www.mobiledevicemanager.com/mobile-device-statistics/250-million-android-devices-in-use).

Additionally, Java technology provides interactive capabilities to all Blu-ray devices and is the most popular programming language in the TIOBE Programming Community Index (www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci), on PYPL: the PopularitY of Programming Language Index (http://sites.google.com/site/pydatalog/pypl/PyPL-PopularitY-of-Programming-Language), and on other indexes.

## Java Technologies

1. Java SE - Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) lets you develop and deploy Java applications on desktops and servers. Java offers the rich user interface, performance, versatility, portability, and security that today's applications require.
2. Java Embedded - Oracle Java Embedded: Unlocking the Value of the Internet of Things with Intelligence on Devices
3. Java EE - Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) is the standard in community-driven enterprise software. Java EE is developed using the Java Community Process, with contributions from industry experts, commercial and open source organizations, Java User Groups, and countless individuals.
4. Java ME
5. Java DB
6. Java TV
7. Java Card

## JDK8

1. JDK8 was created to simplify programming i.e way of writing code in less no. of lines.
2. It's also influenced by the hardware influence i.e CPU became multicore, majority of java programs used only one core.JDK8 enabled parallel programming/procesing so that Java programs can run in multi-processors.
3. Utilizes functional programming benefits into java. i.e we can pass code as method argument.

## Features in JDK8

1. Lamda Expression
2. Functional Interface
3. Defaut methods
4. Static methods
5. Method Reference Operator(::)
6. Stream API
7. Optional class
8. CompletableFuture, Asynchronous Programming
9. New Date & Time API.

           calls                         calls

Stream API-------->Functional Interface--------->Lambda Expressions

Functional interfaces are used to call Lambda expressions.Lambda expressions is used to reduce no. of lines of code.
