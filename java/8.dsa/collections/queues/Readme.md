# Queue

The 'Queue' interface extends 'Collection' interface and declares the behaviour of a queue. 'Queue' being an interface needs a class which provides implementation to its methods and also that we can create objects of that class. 'LinkedList' and 'PriorityQueue' are the most commonly used classes used while creating a queue object.

A queue is an ordered list of objects which are processed in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner, i.e. elements are inserted at the tail or rear-end of the queue whereas removal of elements occur at the head or front-end of the queue.
