# Map Interface

A map stores key-value pairs. Both key and values are objects. Using a key you can find its value. Keys must be unique, but the values may contain duplicates.

The 'Map' interface maps unique keys to values. A key is an object that can be used to retrieve its corresponding value. The 'AbstractMap' class implements most of the 'Map' interface and serves as a superclass for all concrete map implementations.
