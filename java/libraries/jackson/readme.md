# Jackson Libraries

In Java, we need to work with data of different types of formats. In software development, we have to save, load, and transfer data into various formats. The JSON format is one of the formats which is mostly used in software development. Besides JSON, there are many more data formats such as CSV, XML, BSON, and Avro.

Jackson library is basically a suite of data processing libraries. The Jackson JSON library is a parser/generator library for transferring a .class file into a JSON format or JSON string. The Java Jackson library provides data binding and annotations, which can convert POJO objects into data or generate POJO from data.
