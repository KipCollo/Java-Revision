# JAXB [XML Parsing Library]

Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) is an XML parsing library, that provides ways to bind XML schemas and Java representation. It offers ways to marshal Java objects into XML data and unmarshal the XML data into Java objects. The Java Standard Library in Java 9 no longer supports XML functionalities. Therefore developers have to use separate libraries like JAXB for it. To list a few of the features of JAXB, these are-

Supports all W3C XML schema features:

- Reduced number of generated schema-derived classes
- Smaller run time libraries
- Validation capabilities
- Supports Java to XML with a dedicated package to control the binding
