# Maven Libraries

Just like Apache Commons, Maven is also provided by the Apache. It is a comprehensive tool that is based on the project object model. By using Maven, we can build java web and desktop applications. Maven is a repository that manages configurations, documentation, build configuration, and dependency by specifying them in the pom.xml file.

Maven helps us to add a set of jar files in each project, create the right project structure and build and deploy the project.
