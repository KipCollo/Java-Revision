# Google-json

Google-json is similar to Jackson, which is mainly used to convert Java Objects to JSON and vice versa. We need to convert the Java object into JSON and other formats when developing mobile applications and writing and using Rest APIs in Java applications.

It provides methods such as toJson() and fromJson() for converting objects into JSON and vice versa. It has extensive support of Java generics and provides custom representations for objects. We can convert the pre-existing unmodifiable objects into JSON or can form them and generate them from the JSON by using the Google-json library.
