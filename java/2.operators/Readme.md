# OPERATORS

A java `operator` is a special symbol that can be applied to a set of variables,values,or literals and that returns a result.`Operand` refers to the value or variable the operator is being applied to.The result of the operation is referred to as a `result`.

## Type of operators

Java supports three flavors of operators: unary, binary, and ternary. These types of operators can be applied to one, two, or three operands, respectively.

Operator Precedence:- In mathematics, certain operators can override other operators and be evaluated first. Determining which operators are evaluated in what order is referred to as `operator precedence`.The multiplication operator (*) has a higher precedence than the addition operator (+).The assignment operator (=) has the lowest order of precedence

- `Arithmetic Operators`:- Arithmetic operators are those that operate on numeric values.
   1. Addition a + b Adds two numeric values
   2. Subtraction c -Â­ d Subtracts two numeric values
   3. Multiplication e * f Multiplies two numeric values
   4. Division g / h Divides one numeric value by another
   5. Modulus i % j Returns the remainder after division of one numeric value by another

- `Assignment Operator`:-An assignment operator is a binary operator that modifies, or assigns, the variable on the left side of the operator with the result of the value on the right side of the equation. Unlike most other Java operators, the assignment operator is evaluated from right to left.

Java will automatically promote from smaller to larger data types, as you saw in the previous section on arithmetic operators, but it will throw a compiler exception if it detects that you are trying to convert from larger to smaller data types without casting.

The simplest assignment operator is the = assignment
