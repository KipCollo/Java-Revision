# List Interface

List is an ordered collection.It maintains the insertion order, meaning it will display elements in same order in which they got inserted.It provides control over position where you can insert element.

You can access elements by their index and also search elements in list.It allows duplicate items, allows 'null' elements.

Some implementations include: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vectors, Stack, CopyOnWriteArrayList.

The 'List' interface extends the 'Collection' interface and declares the behavior of a collection that stores a sequence of elements. Elements can be added or accessed by their position in the list, using a zero-based index. A list may also contain duplicate elements.
