# Variables

Variables are names given to data that we need to store and manipulate in our programs.

✓ Identifiers: An identifier is a name for something. The identifier’s mean-
ing can change from one program to another, but some identifiers’
­meanings tend to change more.

• Identifiers created by you and me: As a Java programmer (yes, even
as a novice Java programmer), you create new names for classes
and other things that you describe in your programs. Of course,
you may name something Prime, and the guy writing code two
cubicles down the hall can name something else Prime. That’s
okay because Java doesn’t have a predetermined meaning for
Prime. In your program, you can make Prime stand for the Federal
Reserve’s prime rate. And the guy down the hall can make Prime
stand for the “bread, roll, preserves, and prime rib.” A conflict
­doesn’t arise, because you and your co-worker are writing two
­different Java programs.

• Identifiers from the API: The JCP members have created names for
many things and thrown almost 40,000 of these names into the
Java API. The API comes with each version of Java, so these names
are available to anyone who writes a Java program. Examples
of such names are String, Integer, JWindow, JButton,
JTextField, and File.
