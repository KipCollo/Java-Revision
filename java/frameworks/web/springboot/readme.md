# Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an open source, microservice-based Java web framework. The Spring Boot framework creates a fully production-ready environment that is completely configurable using its prebuilt code within its codebase. The microservice architecture provides developers with a fully enclosed application, including embedded application servers.
