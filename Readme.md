# Java Ecosystem

It incudes all Frameworks,Tools and Technologies for modern development.

## Frameworks

1. Spring Framework:- For building enterprise-level applications.Spring is a powerful open-source Java platform (framework), that is used to create and maintain web applications. It starts as the Spring Framework providing a Dependency Injection Container. Spring Boot is an autoconfigurable packaging of multiple Spring projects (like Data, MVC, REST etc) initially created for creating microservices or quick PoC (Proof of concepts).
2. Spring Boot:- Simplifies Spring-based application development.Spring Boot is an open source, microservice-based Java web framework. The Spring Boot framework creates a fully production-ready environment that is completely configurable using its prebuilt code within its codebase. The microservice architecture provides developers with a fully enclosed application, including embedded application servers.
3. Hibernate:- For Object-Relational Mapping(ORM) Hibernate is an open source object-relational mapping tool that provides a framework to map object-oriented domain models to relational databases for web applications. Hibernate implements the specifications of JPA. Performance is key so Hibernate supports first-level and second-level caching.A powerful ORM tool that simplifies database operations and maps Java objects to tables, enhancing productivity and reducing boilerplate code.Core features are ORM, caching, and database abstraction.Use cases are Best for database-driven applications like ERP systems or apps requiring complex database interactions.

8. Quarkus:- Optimized for Kubernetes and cloud-native development.Quarkus is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot and GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards. It is a full-stack, Kubernetes-native Java framework made for Java virtual machines (JVMs) and native compilation, optimizing Java specifically for containers and enabling it to become an effective platform for serverless, cloud, and Kubernetes environments.A modern framework optimized for cloud environments,offering excellent integration with Kubernetes and container ecosystems.Features are Kubernetes-native, optimized runtime, and fast startup.Cloud-native microservices and containerized applications.
9. Spark:- Spark is a micro framework for creating web applications in Kotlin and Java 8. Sinatra, a popular Ruby micro framework, was the inspiration for it.
10. Play Framework:- Play Framework is a high-productivity web application framework that allows the model-view-controller pattern. It is written in Scala but can also be used for other programming languages that are compiled and run on the JVM. e.g.Java.A scalable framework built for high-performance web applications, emphasizing reactive programming for modern use cases.Core Features are Reactive streams, asynchronous I/O, and high scalability.Used for Real-time analytics platforms, streaming services, and highly concurrent applications
11. DropWizard:- A minimalist framework focused on quickly building RESTful APIs and small-scale enterprise applications.Features includes RESTful APIs, lightweight libraries, and rapid development.Used for Low; beginner-friendly and straightforward.
