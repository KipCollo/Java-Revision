# Java API for JSON Processing

The Java API for JSON Processing (JSON-P) JSR will develop a Java API to process (for e.g. parse, generate, transform and query) JSON.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data exchange format that is easy for humans and machines to read and write. JSON can represent two structured types: objects and arrays. An object is an unordered collection of zero or more name/value pairs. An array is an ordered sequence of zero or more values. The values can be strings, numbers, booleans, null, and these two structured types.

JSON is often used in Ajax applications, configurations, databases, and RESTful web services. All popular websites offer JSON as the data exchange format with their RESTful web services.
