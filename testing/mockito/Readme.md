# Mockito Framework

Mockito is a mocking framework that lets you write beautiful tests with a clean & simple API.They produce clean verification errors.

Mockito features include:-

1. Mocks concrete classes and interfaces
2. Little annotation syntax. @Mock
3. Verification errors are clean- stack trace(failed verification in test),exception's(actual interaction in code).Stack trace is always clean.
4. Allows flexible verification in order(e.g verify in order what you want,not every single interaction)
5. Supports exact-number-of-times and at-least-once verification.
6. Flexible verification or stubbing using argument matchers(anyObject(),anyString(), or refEq()) for reflection-based equality matching.
7. Allows creating custom argument matchers or using existing hamcrest members.
