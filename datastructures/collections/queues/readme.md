# Queue
	/*
		 * The 'Queue' interface extends 'Collection' interface and declares the
		 * behaviour of a queue. 'Queue' being an interface needs a class which provides
		 * implementation to its methods and also that we can create objects of that
		 * class. 'LinkedList' and 'PriorityQueue' are the most commonly used classes
		 * used while creating a queue object.
