# Spring MVC

Spring MVC is used to develop web apps and and distributed applications.

Creating a container for standalone application:

```java

ApplicationContext context= new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext();
```

The REST capabilities are provided by the Spring MVC module (same module that provides model-view-controller capabilities). It is not a JAX-RS implementation and can be seen as a Spring alternative to the JAX-RS standard.
